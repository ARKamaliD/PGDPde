Fill out the fields above and put a short introduction here (instead of this text). Concerning the language of the introduction, choose either English or German (preferably the language of your tutor session).

Here is a short explanation for the fields above:
- firstName (your first name; required)
- lastName (your last name; required)
- image (a picture of you, you can put into `/src/tutors/img/`; optional)
- website (link to your website; optional)
- session (day and time of your weekly session; required)
- location (location of your session; required)
- language (language of your session - either `en` or `de`; required)
- sessionLink (link to your session; optional)
- color (color of your card - either `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `red` or `purple`; optional)

If you want to skip an optional field, delete the entire line.

If you need more help, just get inspired by the introductions of the other tutors.
